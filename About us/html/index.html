			<h2>Our Story</h2>
			<!-- <div class="line"></div> -->

			<p>Before this place was a restaurant, it was a dream. A dream born on the quiet shores of Arish, between
				the whisper of the sea and the warmth of the Sinai sun. The idea was never just to serve food, but to
				create a space where stories are told, memories are made, and people come together around a single
				table. We wanted to build a place that feels like coming home, where the aroma of authentic cooking
				blends with the spirit of heritage and the laughter of friends and family.</p>

			<p>Our story began by gathering the recipes we inherited—the ones written in the hearts of our ancestors
				long before they were ever put on paper. We traveled through the villages of Sinai, listening to the
				elders and learning the secrets of the land and the sea. We learned that every ingredient has its own
				soul, and that patience is the most essential spice. Every corner of this restaurant, every piece of
				furniture, and every plate we serve carries a piece of that journey. It is not just decor; it is a part
				of our collective memory.</p>

			<p>Today, "Our Story" no longer belongs to us alone; it has become the story of every guest who shares their
				moments with us. It’s the story of friends reuniting, families celebrating, and a traveler finding a
				warm refuge. Every dish that leaves our kitchen is a new chapter in this ongoing story, one that we
				write together with the authentic flavor of Sinai and the generosity of its people. This is our promise:
				that this place will always be more than a restaurant. It will remain a home, open to all, where endless
				stories are told.</p>

			<h2>Our Food</h2>
			<!-- <div class="line"></div> -->

			<p>People often ask about the secret to our food, searching for a specific recipe or a hidden ingredient.
				The truth is, our secret lies within the story of the food itself. It’s a story that begins here, in the
				heart of Sinai, between the desert and the sea. It starts with our grandmother, whose hands knew the
				language of the earth, gathering wild herbs, and with our grandfather, a patient fisherman who brought
				back the daily gifts of the Mediterranean. Our food was born on the plate where their two worlds met.
			</p>

			<p>This legacy was not taught in words, but passed down through senses—through taste, touch, and aroma. We
				inherited the passion of our ancestors, a flame that we now keep alive in the heart of our kitchen. That
				is why "Our Food" means more than just what we own; it is what we share. It is a story that connects our
				family, our land, our memories, and you. When you sit at our table, you become part of that story, and
				our food becomes yours.</p>

				<h2>Owner</h2>

				<p>Turkish chef Mehmet Burak Özdemir, born in 1994 in the culinary-rich city of Antakya, rose from his
					family's restaurant business to become a global internet sensation. Inheriting a passion for cooking
					from his father and grandfather, he began his career at a young age in Istanbul. It was his unique
					approach on social media that catapulted him to fame; by preparing enormous-sized Turkish and Arab
					dishes with a constant, wide smile aimed directly at the camera, he created a viral brand. His
					captivating videos on Instagram and TikTok attracted millions of followers, turning his restaurants
					into must-visit destinations for celebrities and food enthusiasts from around the world.</p>

				<p>Capitalizing on his digital fame, Chef Burak expanded his "CZNBurak" restaurant chain from its
					Turkish roots to major international hubs like Dubai and Doha. However, his journey to building a
					global empire was met with a significant personal and professional crisis. He publicly accused his
					father of selling the rights to his brand name without his consent, a dispute that led to legal
					action. This challenging chapter revealed the adversities behind his public smile, forcing him to
					announce a new, independent start to his career.</p>

				<h2>Chef</h2>

				<p>Our Chef Ahmed Kamel is the soul of our kitchen, a storyteller who uses flavor to share his deep
					connection to Sinai. He didn't train in a formal culinary school but learned directly from the land
					and its people—the fishermen, Bedouin women, and local farmers were his teachers. This unique
					heritage shaped his philosophy of creating honest food that respects and showcases the natural
					beauty of each ingredient. Every plate he prepares is more than just a meal; it is a personal
					expression of his love for the region's authentic tastes, offering you a genuine piece of his story.
